I'm a machine learning data scientist
passionate about building new ML-backed systems and applications
that delight their users. 
My primary interest is 
[MLOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLOps). 
I spent a decade studying 
[dark energy and dark matter](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy)
as an academic researcher,
and another decade modeling product demand, ad engagement, lifetime value, and
recommendations 
at [two](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/joymode) [startups](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/velos-2)
and [Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.com/).
I've also occasionally served as a pro bono Data Ambassador for [DataKind](https://www.datakind.org/).

I hold a PhD from Harvard 
and a BA from Berkeley with specialties in astrophysics and cosmology, 
and I held research positions at Caltech and the University of Chicago. 
I've made my publications from this period available under
[Publications]({% link _pages/publications.md %}).

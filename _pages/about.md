I'm a data scientist working on machine learning systems at [Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.com/). 
I've also worked at two startups, [Joymode](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/joymode) 
and [Velos/Sociocast Networks](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/velos-2),
and briefly at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/). 
I have occasionally served as a pro bono Data Ambassador for [DataKind](https://www.datakind.org/).

I hold a PhD from Harvard and a BA from Berkeley with specialties in astrophysics and cosmology, 
and I've held research positions at U Chicago and Caltech. 
As an academic I specialized in studies of dark energy and dark matter 
using gravitational lensing and the clustering of galaxies.

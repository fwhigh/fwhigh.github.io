I am the head of data science and ML engineering at
{% include linkout.html href="https://tala.co/" text="Tala" %}.
My scope includes predictive ML, causal inference, AB testing, and AI.
My superpower is speeding up data science.

I have a PhD in physics from Harvard
and a BA in physics from Berkeley
and I've held research posts at Caltech and U Chicago.
I spent a decade studying
{% include linkout.html href="https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy" text="dark energy and dark matter" %}.
I've made my publications from this period available under
[Publications]({% link _pages/publications.md %}).

I've since moved into the private sector
modeling product demand, 
ad engagement, 
lifetime value, 
recommendations, 
pricing, 
and more
at {% include linkout.html href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/joymode" text="two" %} {% include linkout.html href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/velos-2" text="startups" %},
{% include linkout.html href="https://netflixtechblog.com/" text="Netflix" %},
and {% include linkout.html href="https://discord.com/" text="Discord" %}.
I've also occasionally served as a pro bono Data Ambassador for {% include linkout.html href="https://www.datakind.org/" text="DataKind" %}.

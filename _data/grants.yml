  takeaway: A Hubble telescope proposal to image seven galaxy clusters that were detected by the South Pole Telescope, measure the clusters' masses using weak gravitational lensing, and then use the masses to measure dark energy. The galaxy cluster abundance and mass distribution is highly sensitive to the amount of dark energy in the universe.
